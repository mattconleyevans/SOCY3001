Water level in day low and quality poor. Dam may be supported by groundwater as it retains water much longer than other former dams in the vicinity, which are currently dry and craking. Dam is ringed with a dense, sedgeland dominated by {Eleocharis acuta}, well above the residual water. Mudflat species occur at the boundary between the sedgeland and bare slopes include {Crassula helmsii, Elatine gratioloides}, and {Glossostigma diandrum} and {G. cleistanthum}. {Crassula helmsii} and {Elatine gratioloides} from mats that colonise down-slope; whereas {G. diandrum} forms dense patches at the mud-sedgeland boundary and {G. cleistanthum} occurs slightly higher up, as understorey to {E. acuta}.

Water level in dam low and quality poor. Dam may be supported by groundwater as it retains water much longer than other former dams in the vicinity, which are currently dry and craking. Dam is ringed with a dense, sedgeland dominated by {Eleocharis acuta}, well above the residual water. Mudflat species occur at the boundary between the sedgeland and bare slopes include {Crassula helmsii, Elatine gratioloides}, and {Glossostigma diandrum} and {G. cleistanthum}. {Crassula helmsii} and {Elatine gratioloides} form mats that colonise down-slope; whereas {G. diandrum} forms dense patches at the mud-sedgeland boundary, and {G. cleistanthum} occurs slightly higher up, as understorey to {E. acuta}. Because it is slightly higher up than the other mudflat species, it is beginning to senesce, hence it is yellow-green in colour. The mudflat species occurred extensively on the northerly-facing slopes and were generally absent from the southerly-facing slopes.
